            <td>I’m a first-year B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering student at Central University of Jammu.

I'm currently building my foundation in programming, data structures, and computer systems, while actively exploring emerging fields like AI, web development, and open-source contribution. My academic interests include artificial intelligence, software development, and systems programming. I am also exploring opportunities to participate in research, internships, and collaborative projects.

I am highly motivated, detail-oriented, and committed to continuous learning. My long-term academic goal is to pursue a Master’s degree (M.Tech) in Computer Science from a leading institution in the United States — with a particular aspiration to study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

Outside of tech, I am a guitarist, a sportsperson and represented my school in basketball at various levels.</td>

            <li><h3>College Database System</h3></li>
            <p>This project is a simple console-based Student Database Management System developed in C using structures.
                It allows users to store, display, search, and analyze student records in a structured and organized manner.
                The project demonstrates the practical use of structures, arrays, loops, and conditional statements in C programming, making it ideal for beginners and academic purposes.</p>

            <li><h3>Console Based Student Record Manager</h3></li>
            <p>This is a menu-driven console application written in C that manages student records using file handling operations.
            The program stores student data such as roll number, name, course, and marks in a text file and demonstrates the usage of all major file access modes:
            r, w, a, r+, w+, and a+. This project is ideal for academic learning, 1st-year C programming, and understanding persistent data storage using files.</p>

            <li>HTML Based Resume</li>
            <p>Developed a personal resume website using pure HTML to present academic background, technical skills, projects, and contact information in a structured format. The project focuses on understanding core HTML concepts such as headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, images, and hyperlinks. It serves as a foundational web development project and a digital version of a traditional resume.</p>
